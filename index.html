                        <p>I recently left a financial services position at JP Morgan Chase to pursue a career in software engineering.  
                        Computer programming is new to me, but so far I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of building and creating websites.
                        I am very excited to begin my journey in web development at Thinkful. Currently, I reside in Sea Isle City, NJ.</p>
                        <p>With a background in financial services, I am ultimately interested in a career in FinTech. I am focused on developing 
                        a tech skillset to compliment my understanding of financial products & operations. I am confident that a programming skillset
                        will make me more marketable for positions in the FinTech space that require an understanding of both software engineering and finance.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="group">
                    <div class="item item-double">
                        <p>I have always been fascinated by the web, but never put the time in to better understand the mechanics behind it. After feeling a lack of fulfillment
                        in various financial operations roles, I decided to explore options in web development. After a few modules in Thinkful's prep course, I became
                        increasingly interested in enrolling in a full-time bootcamp and making a career change. I have never been more excited about the future of my career
                        and cannot wait to begin learning from and collaborating with others in the software engineering space.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not coding, I am usually exercising, reading or watching sports. My favorite exercise is running and I typically run at least fifteen miles a week. I
                        mostly read nonfiction biographies about successful entrepreneurs, and also enjoy reading interesting business articles online. My favorite sports teams are the New York Jets and the 
                        Brooklyn Nets. Before Covid, I got to the Barclay's Center and Meadowlands Stadium for at least one game every season.</p>
                        <h3>Client Service Offering:</h3>
                        <p>Before transitioning to software engineering full-time, I worked in financial services and obtained my MBA from NYU's Stern School of Business. Now as a computer programmer, I 
                            focus on utilizing the latest technology & frameworks to build user-friendly web applications. I am focused on adding value for clients in the FinTech space. Please see below 
                            for my financial and programming skillsets:
