# Portfolio

In my portfolio, you can learn about my background and why I have decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I have created placeholder content for the apps that I will create during my time at Thinkful. I also discuss what plans I have for the future as well as what I like to do in my free time. If you have questions or would like to contact me, please submit your information in the form at the bottom of the page.
